# Example code for the class CSC 485, "Testing for Developers"

## Basic Design

Every homework assignment will involve application code to be tested, and the test code.

The assignment's application code goes in a python package (folder + _ _ init_ _.py file) under the "projects" folder.

The assignment's test code goes in a same-named folder under the "tests" folder.
